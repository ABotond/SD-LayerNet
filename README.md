# SD-LayerNet

Spatial Decomposition Layer Segmentation network.

This repository contains a reference PyTorch implementation of SD-LayerNet, presented in [SD-LayerNet: Semi-supervised retinal layer segmentation in OCT using disentangled representation with anatomical priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00458).

The source-code is currently provided as a reference, and cannot be trained out of the box, however, it contains the full implementation of SD-LayerNet (in the folder architecture), as well es the training code in model.py. 


## Prerequisites
 * PyTorch 1.9.1
 * Cuda 11
 * Python 3.9
 * opencv-python
 
 
## To Do
Soon we will add code for training on public datasets.
